What Are Network Security Services?
Network security services are an intricate defensive system created to protect any computer devices and systems from potential cyber threats, data leakage, or other malicious activity. More specifically, network security protects against the following:

Phishing Attacks: Attackers steal sensitive data like passwords or credit card information.
Malware: Malware such as viruses, Trojans, and other malicious programs damage or disrupt a computer network.
Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) Attacks: Multiple computers or network devices flood a network with requests, making the network impossible to access.
Unauthorized Access: Unauthorized users gain network access.
Data Leakage: Private data is shared or made available to unauthorized parties.
Brute Force: Hackers will bombard a network with numerous and repeated login attempts.
Security services range from proactive firewalls and malware protection to more advanced strategies such as intrusion detection and prevention, network monitoring, and identity management. Businesses can use these services to help ensure the safety of their network and protect their data from malicious actors.
